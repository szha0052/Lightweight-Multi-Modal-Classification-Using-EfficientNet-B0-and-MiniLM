# Lightweight Multi-Modal Classification Using EfficientNet-B0 and MiniLM

## üõ†Ô∏è Running Instructions
To run the project:

1. 1. Open this shared Google Drive link:  
   üëâ [COMP5329_A2 Shared Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E8OcgpVay_1RB-XrBSOKkBDs9LacFC-6?usp=drive_link)

2. Move the folder `COMP5329_A2` into your own Google Drive under `MyDrive`.  
   You can do this by dragging it as shown below:
   ![Action I](Figure1.png)
   ![Action II](Figure2.png)
   ![Action III](Figure3.png)

2. The folder contains:
   - `COMP5329S1A2Dataset`: raw input and training data
   - `process`: preprocessed intermediate files
   - `model`: final saved model weights

3. Visit the GitHub repository:  
   https://github.com/szha0052/Lightweight-Multi-Modal-Classification-Using-EfficientNet-B0-and-MiniLM

4. Open both notebooks: `COMP5329_A2_All.ipynb` and `COMP5329_A2_Pre.ipynb`, and click "Open in Colab" to run them.

5. After verifying Google Drive access in the first code cell, you can execute all remaining blocks.
